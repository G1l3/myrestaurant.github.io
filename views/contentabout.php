						<h1>Welcome To <span>Yamifood Restaurant</span></h1>
						<h4>Little Story</h4>
						<span>Restaurants are an institution in nearly every country and culture in the world. The restaurant, which emerged during the French Revolution, continues to serve as a place where people come together to eat, drink, and socialize. But even before Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI were sent to the guillotine, restaurants have been around in one form or another for thousands of years.</span></br>
